Welcome to the qmesh User Manual
===================================

qmesh is a python package built to facilitate generation of high-quality meshes for geophysical domains, and is available under the GPLv3 licence.
As a python package, its primary interface is a python API, but a command line interface as well as a graphical interface have also been developed.

If you use qmesh in your work please cite the following papers, written by the qmesh developers and other collaborators:
